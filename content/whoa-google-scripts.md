I just found out this new Google Script thing, and after some testing I decided that would do a review for it.

How I Found This
----------------

For a long time I've been looking for a way to get all my old emails and chats with my GF(since the email she used then was another and lost to her). I could go one by one in my Gmail, and forward it to her new one, but this would be unthinkable (since there were a LOT of emails).

And finally I found this Google Script, and after one day playing with it, all those emails where already forwarded to her new gmail... Yes, it was very easy.

What is this GoogleScript
-------------------------

Basically it's a JavaScript that offers you access to many GoogleApps services, and let you use then(with some limitations) to create something new, or simply automate a job.

Creating a New Google Script
----------------------------

To create a new google script you can go to: <https://script.google.com/>  
Or go to [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/ "https://drive.google.com/")(or Google Docs if you haven't migrated yet) and create a new **"Script"**.

After this you can create a **Empty Project** and already start working on it!

Documentation
-------------

There are lots... I mean, lots...  
In this page you can find everything you need to get started: <https://developers.google.com/apps-script/>.

And also if you have any doubts you can check the StackOverflow Tag: [google-apps-script](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-apps-script "google-apps-script") that is the official support center for this.

What can be done?
-----------------

Well, many things, as you can see, it can be made to create some simple scripts for you and/or your company to automate things for you.  
Like, creating a Google Docs, at the beginning at a meeting(in Google Calendar), with some content like the header of the document, and other things right from the Calendar.  
So if you have a meeting now, and the Event in the Calendar is called "Superb Meeting", it could create a doc, share it for everyone in the company, and put the content:  
**"This is the report of what was discussed in the: "Superb Meeting", at "Time of the meeting"**

You can also use it to create some more complex applications, or even games, and put them in the Web Store.

Conclusion
----------

I believe that everyone that uses the Google Apps in a intense way should take a look at this, and you'll see that with just a bit of effort you can make some improvement in the use of these technologies.

And yes, it's very easy to use, they have it very well documented (Even myself, a monkey in JS, managed to use it).

That's for now.
