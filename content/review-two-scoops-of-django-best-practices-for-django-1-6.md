I decided to make this review because this book **helped me** a lot, and is a **must-have** for anyone interested in delving into Django.

Really good tips
----------------

This book has some pretty neat tips that even good developers are not aware of.  
For example, I got excited to use the [relative imports in python 2.7](http://www.arruda.blog.br/programacao/python-relative-imports-and-headaches/ "Python – Relative Imports and Headaches") after I read about that in it.

Some other examples are:

-   the **project layout** they propose is very good (although I use it with some changes, but that's just my preferences)
-   all the **REST API** related stuff
-   best practices for **Class Based Views**(CBVs)
-   some **third-party** project that are very useful

Covers Many Topics
------------------

This book covers many topics of a Django project, and in all of them you'll probably learn (or remember) something that you forgot, that may help you in a project of yours.

So if you have already done the first Django tutorial, and want to know the **best of everything** in Django, then this is the book for you.

Easy to Read
------------

Another good point (a very important one in fact), is that this book was written in a way that  
makes it easy to keep on reading.  
The authors often make some **jokes**, and reduce the problems or examples into some **very simple** yet **meaningful** images and diagrams (often related to an **Ice Cream** Store context).  
Another good point in this, is that you can **read** the book as you please, **in any order**, because the chapters are independent from each other.

Tasty Ice Cream Metaphors
-------------------------

After finishing this book, what will you do?

-   Put in practice the new stuff you learned
-   Go eat some ice cream
-   **Both of the answers**

Not only the metaphors are **funny** and **useful**, as they are **tasty** too.  
**So remember to have some ice cream next to you whenever you're reading.**

Also you can **mark all this phrases** and whenever you're felling sad because of some difficulty in your project, you just have to **read them to boost your mood**.

Humbly Written
--------------

Yet another good point of this book.  
The authors ([Daniel](http://pydanny.com/ "Daniel Greenfeld") and [Audrey](http://audreyr.com/ "Audrey Roy")) **didn't write** the book as if they where the **Keepers of The Truth**.  
So whenever they can, they give you plenty of **different approaches** to a given subject and only **point out** what they think it's **best for them**.  
And of course, they provide **may links** for further reading, that also show that they have a **solid base** for what is written, that they didn't came out with it from out of nowhere.

That's all folks!  
**Good reading** and **plenty of ice creams** for you.
